### Setting Up GitHub Actions

To automatically update your README with data from the GitHub API, you can set up a GitHub Actions workflow. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:**

   In your repository, create a directory named `.github/workflows`. Inside this directory, create a file named `update_readme.yml`.

   ```yaml
   name: Update README

   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs every day at midnight
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     update-readme:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout Repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Fetch GitHub Stats
           uses: actions/github-script@v3
           id: fetch_stats
           with:
             github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             script: |
               const response = await github.request('GET /users/okeomasilachi');
               return response.data;

         - name: Update README
           uses: actions/github-script@v3
           with:
             github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             script: |
               const fs = require('fs');
               const readmePath = 'README.md';
               let readme = fs.readFileSync(readmePath, 'utf8');
               const newData = JSON.stringify(${fetch_stats.outputs.result}, null, 2);
               readme = readme.replace(/<!-- GITHUB_STATS -->(.*?)<!-- END_GITHUB_STATS -->/s, `<!-- GITHUB_STATS -->\n${newData}\n<!-- END_GITHUB_STATS -->`);
               fs.writeFileSync(readmePath, readme);
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

2. **Add the Placeholder in README:**

   Modify your `README.md` to include a placeholder where the data will be inserted:

   ```markdown
   ## GitHub Stats

   <!-- GITHUB_STATS -->
   <!-- END_GITHUB_STATS -->

   ```
